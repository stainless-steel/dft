//! [Discrete Fourier transform][1].
//!
//! The `Transform` trait is responsible for performing the transform. The trait
//! is implemented for both real and complex data. There are three transform
//! operations available: forward, backward, and inverse. The desired operation
//! is specified by the `Operation` enumeration passed to the `Plan::new`
//! function, which precomputes auxiliary information needed for
//! `Transform::transform`. All the operations are preformed in place.
//!
//! When applied to real data, the transform works as follows. If the operation
//! is forward, the data are replaced by the positive frequency half of their
//! complex transform. The first and last components of the complex transform,
//! which are real, are stored in `self[0]` and `self[1]`, respectively. If the
//! operation is backward or inverse, the data are assumed to be stored
//! according to the above convention. See the reference below for further
//! details.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```
//! use dft::{Operation, Plan, c64};
//!
//! let plan = Plan::new(Operation::Forward, 512);
//! let mut data = vec![c64::new(42.0, 69.0); 512];
//! dft::transform(&mut data, &plan);
//! ```
